THINGS TO CONSIDER:

- Terminal: rails db => add POSTGRESQL database to your database
- Tables for ActiveRecord objects are named in plural form by default. e.g. Users. This naming convention was circumvented by adding "ActiveRecord::Base.pluralize_table_names = false" to your config/environment.rb, which will disable pluralization for all ActiveRecord objects.

- Need to create models based on "ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables".  This is a list of all the models and I need to convert all my tables into models (including taking the '_' and converting the next letter to a capital letter)

- Call on every column in every table via looping through "ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables[i].column_names" ("i = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables.count"), which gather all the column names of all the tables into one view.

- Build out the MVP for the dynamic tables interface - Downloaded Start Bootstrap Scrolling Nav, to start building a beautiful, clean GUI for selecting tables and columns.

- Create a section on the right that is layered on top of the Bootstrap, so that selected attributes can be added appropriately.
