THINGS TO CONSIDER:

- Terminal: rails db => add POSTGRESQL database to your database
- Tables for ActiveRecord objects are named in plural form by default. e.g. Users. This naming convention was circumvented by adding "ActiveRecord::Base.pluralize_table_names = false" to your config/environment.rb, which will disable pluralization for all ActiveRecord objects.
